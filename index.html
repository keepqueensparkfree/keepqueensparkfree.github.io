          On <strong>June 13th</strong>, City Council will decide whether to designate Queen's Park a Heritage Conservation Area, which would be <strong>involuntary</strong> and have a significant impact on all homeowners. 
          We believe the current proposal does not take homeowner rights and financial risks into account. Please contact City Council with your thoughts and attend the Advisory Planning Commission meeting on<br /><strong>May 9th at 6:30pm</strong>.

          <h1>Who are we?</h1>
          <p>We are a diverse group of Queen’s Park homeowners. Some of us have lived here for many decades, others only a few years. Our homes range in style and size, but most are modest and small. We support heritage conservation too, but we believe that the proposed Heritage Conservation Area (HCA) policy could divide our community into winners and losers, and put the well-being of some families at risk. In our opinion, heritage conservation cannot be effectively achieved by forcing unfair restrictions on others. Ironically, making owners feel punished discourages the ownership of heritage homes... the very thing the city says it is trying to promote! We feel that no one should have the right to potentially cause other residents financial harm or negatively impact their enjoyment of their own properties. All families in Queen’s Park are important, and none should be treated like collateral damage.</p>

          <h1>Concerns</h1>
          <h2>Divides community into winners and losers</h2>
          <p>The current policy divides owners into two categories (advanced protection and limited protection) based solely on the ages of their homes (not livability or size), and places significantly more restrictions on the owners in the advanced category. Small, modest homes are treated the same as large architectural gems. A recent report commissioned by the City of Vancouver indicated that the owners of small homes on small lots face far greater challenges and are much more likely to lose under these types of restrictions, but our proposed HCA policy does not have any special provisions to prevent harm. For some residents, our homes are our sole financial asset, and the only means we have of ensuring a secure future. Like a lot of families in the Lower Mainland, we live paycheque-to-paycheque and cannot afford to risk our homes being devalued overnight.</p>
          
          <h2>Property devaluation</h2>
          <p>Jason Grant, acting vice-president of BC Assessment, <a href="http://theprovince.com/opinion/columnists/gordon-clark-getting-straight-assessment-facts-during-b-c-election-campaign" target="_blank">confirmed to The Province</a> newspaper that designated homes in First Shaughnessy's HCA were subject to a "12-per-cent downward adjustment" specifically "because of the heritage designation". Other real estate experts have also indicated that restrictions on homes will likely put downward pressure on their market value, particularly small homes on small lots.</p>

          <h2>Increased costs</h2>
          <p>All additional costs associated with adhering to Heritage Conservation Area requirements must be covered by homeowners. The financial burden will be particularly hard on owners with limited budgets and young families.</p>

          <h2>Undemocratic</h2>
          <p>Homeowners do not get to cast a ballot. The decision is entirely up to city council, and your land title will be changed with or without your consent.</p>

          <h2>Creates uncertainty for growing families</h2>
          <p>Young neighbours with large mortgages and no equity are the most at risk if the HCA negatively impacts home values. We want young families to be attracted to Queen’s Park and keep our streets, schools and parks vibrant. However, these families are looking for houses that they can remodel as their families grow, and may be discouraged from staying or buying here because of the added cost and uncertainty.</p>

          <h2>Unfair design restrictions</h2>
          <p>The HCA policy would have <a href="http://www.newwestcity.ca/database/files/library/QP_DGs___March_6_report.pdf" target="_blank">mandatory design guidelines</a> for existing advanced-category houses. Exterior renovations on the front and sides of homes will have to go through an additional design review process to request a Heritage Alteration Permit (HAP) to determine whether they comply with design guidelines. This will prevent some owners from modifying their homes in order to meet their families’ needs, and will be especially burdensome for small home owners. Additionally, some of the design features that are forbidden under the HCA commonly exist within Queen’s Park (e.g. street-facing garage doors).</p>
          
          <h2>Coriolis reports</h2>
          <p>Here are links to the two Coriolis reports, which were recently commissioned by the City of Vancouver. We feel they contain lessons that can be applied to our neighbourhood.</p>

        <section id="faq">
          <h1>FAQ</h1>
          <h2>Do you care about heritage conservation?</h2>
          <p>Of course we do! We would love to believe that everyone will win under the current HCA policy, but we are certain that will not be the case. We believe that a heritage conservation initiative can only succeed if it addresses the challenges of our modern times, including our real estate market. Our concerns will be even bigger concerns to the next generation, whom we hope will want to live in Queen’s Park too. This is an interesting topic within the heritage community, and experts are coming up with innovative ideas to promote voluntary conservation.</p>
 
          <h2>Are you anti-HCA?</h2>
          <p>We are not all necessarily opposed to the idea of an HCA, but we are opposed to the current HCA policy drafted by the City of New Westminster. If guardrails were added to the policy to ensure that families would be protected from significant loss, we could support it. We have suggested that families be able to choose the type of protection (limited or advanced) that is right for their homes, or that families in the advanced category be guaranteed that they can move down to the limited category if they suffer a financial loss due to the HCA. We feel this is a very reasonable compromise, as we would still be losing many freedoms enjoyed by all other homeowners in New West. So far, the city has not acted upon our suggestions, so we currently have no option but to continue to oppose the current HCA plan.</p>
 
          <h2>Did you speak up early in the process?</h2>
          <p>Yes. We attended the open houses and QPRA meetings relating to the HCA and voiced our concerns. We were told that they were being taken into consideration, and to wait for the HCA draft policy to be released. This did not happen until February 20, 2017, at which time we learned that the policy did not reflect those concerns.</p>
 
          <h2>Why don’t you leave Queen’s Park if you don’t like the HCA initiative?</h2>
          <p>Some of us have been told we should move, and that we do not belong in the neighbourhood. This, in our opinion, is a very unfair stance to take. We all love Queen’s Park, and it is divisive to imply that some people belong here more than others. Remember – we all own very old homes, and most of us have no intention of rebuilding. There are several families in our group who would like to rebuild, as the existing houses are very small and unsuitable for their families’ needs. They want to build sympathetic homes that will actually improve the streetscape. In our opinion, Queen’s Park should continue to be an accommodating neighbourhood where families can live in homes that are comfortable and safe.</p>
 
          <h2>What about big box homes?</h2>
          <p>We are willing to support design guidelines for new builds, but feel it is unfair to package the guidelines with many additional restrictions on pre-1941 homes. Some homes are definitely worth preserving (especially the large, architecturally-significant ones), but others are not. Blanket preservation based solely on age places an unfair burden the owners of small, modest homes. Ultimately, even if there are no design guidelines, we feel the vast majority of owners will make good decisions. If a few do not, we feel that the responsibility for that rests solely with those individuals. Over time, it’s possible that those homes will become more appreciated. Perhaps neighbours gasped when the first mid-century modern home was built, and now that style fits in well. Second Street in particular has a vast array of homes from different periods.</p>
          <p>If the HCA does not go through, the city can choose to designate any home it wishes to save from demolition, but it will need to compensate the owner for any loss (unlike under the HCA, where any loss will be absorbed directly by residents). If any owner in Queen’s Park believes their home is worth preserving, they are absolutely free to voluntarily designate it. If you are interested in doing this, please contact the city or the New Westminster Heritage Preservation Society for more information. It’s interesting to note that only a very small number of residents have actually done this.</p>

          <h2>What is all this talk about BC Assessment and a loss of relative value in First Shaughnessy?</h2>
          <p>As you may have heard, BC Assessment recently confirmed to some Queen's Park owners that the land value of protected heritage homes in First Shaughnessy significantly dropped in comparison to the unprotected homes within that neighbourhood. Employees at BC Assessment confirmed that after First Shaughnessy was declared a Heritage Conservation Area in 2015, some owners of the protected homes indicated that their homes’ market values had decreased because of the designation. BC Assessment applied a 5% downward adjustment on their land values. Employees also confirmed that, after later reviewing MLS sales data,  BC Assessment agreed that the designated properties were selling for a “noticeable discount” in comparison to the neighbouring unprotected homes, and applied an additional 12% downward adjustment on land values on the next assessments. This adjustment was made solely to the homes with heritage designations. <a href="#" target="_blank">This fact was confirmed</a> by Jason Grant, the acting vice-president of BC Assessment, to The Province newspaper on April 27, 2017. Anyone is welcome to call BC Assessment and confirm this information for themselves.</p>

          <h2>First Shaughnessy is different from Queen’s Park though, right?</h2>
          <p>Yes - but in a way that is troubling rather than reassuring. First Shaughnessy has very large lots (the average size is approximately 17,000 feet), and the homes in that neighbourhood are generally architecturally-significant mansions. The City of Vancouver offered those owners many incentives including secondary suites, coach houses and infill dwellings, and the large lots ensured that owners would be able to take advantage of them. Additionally, owners in First Shaughnessy are much wealthier than those in Queen’s Park, and are therefore better able to cope with financial strain. Our families are middle class, and our homes may be our sole financial asset. No incentives are currently offered in our proposed HCA policy. Even if incentives are eventually offered, the owners of small homes and lots will likely not be able to make use of them, which we fear could lead to further devaluation. Jay Wollenberg, the president of Coriolis, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8ijeGt7bNw" target="_blank">warned our city council</a> about the risks to small homeowners at the recent Open Workshop held on April 24th.<p>
